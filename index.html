	<h1>Croissant</h1>
	<p>There’s something mysterious– maybe even alchemical— about the qualities that have to come together to yield the ideal
	croissant. To fit the bill, it should be buttery and tender, but never mushy or overly moist. It requires a delicate
	flakiness-to-chewiness ratio that’s remarkably hard to achieve, and the layers of all-butter puff pastry should be well
	differentiated, without falling apart into a crumby mess when you bite into them. The bake should be golden, but not
	overdone. In short, it’s an art: one that the French in particular are very proud of.</p>
